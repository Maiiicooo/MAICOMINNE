        <h2>Project C.</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Update – 2025:</strong> A simple DIY camera built with a
          Raspberry Pi 4, a Pi Camera, and a cheap display from Amazon.<br />
          <span style="color: #888">
            It’s not fancy, not polished, but honestly one of my favorite
            projects so far.
          </span>
        </p>

        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          This is basically just a photo camera. No cloud, no AI, no smart
          features. It just takes photos when you press a button.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wrote a small script in Python using Thonny, connected a Raspberry
          Pi Camera, added a small inexpensive display, and that’s it. But
          somehow… it turned out way cooler than I expected.
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Built It</h3>
        <p>
          I saw a lot of people online building similar Raspberry Pi cameras,
          but almost all of them needed a keyboard connected to trigger the
          photo.
        </p>

        <p>
          To me, that completely killed the experience. Carrying a keyboard
          around just to take a picture felt wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted something that actually feels like a real camera. Press a
          button → take a photo.
        </p>

        <h3>The Button</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of using a keyboard, I soldered a mechanical keyboard switch
          directly to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.
        </p>

        <p>
          That clicky mechanical switch is incredibly satisfying. Pressing it
          and instantly hearing the camera trigger never gets old.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s a tiny detail, but it completely changes how the project feels.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Raspberry Pi 4</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi Camera Module</li>
          <li>6mm camera lens</li>
          <li>Cheap Amazon display</li>
          <li>Python script written in Thonny</li>
          <li>Mechanical keyboard switch wired to GPIO</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The script listens for a GPIO input. When the button is pressed, it
          captures a photo and saves it. No menus, no UI, no distractions.
        </p>

        <h3>Photo Quality</h3>
        <p>
          What surprised me the most is how sharp the photos actually are. For
          such a simple setup, the image quality is way better than I expected.
        </p>

        <p>
          It proves that you don’t need a complex setup to get good results.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          This project isn’t meant to compete with real cameras. It’s just
          something I built because I thought it would be cool. If you want to
          check out my script for the button check it here. <br />

        </p>

        <p>And honestly? It really is.</p>

        <p>
          Pressing a physical button, hearing that click, and knowing the photo
          was taken by something you built yourself is incredibly satisfying.
        </p>
