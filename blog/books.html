<h2>Why I Started Reading</h2>

<p><strong>Update – 08/04/2025:</strong> A short reflection on how I got into reading and the books that stuck with me.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>
I never used to read. Not really. School killed the joy of it for me early on—mandatory novels, boring interpretations, endless overanalysis. For years, books were just something I had to “get through.” Until something shifted.
</p>

<p>
At some point, I started craving depth. I was tired of endless feeds, shallow content, clickbait summaries. I wanted something that took time to unfold. Something that didn’t scream for attention but stayed with me. That’s when I picked up a book again—voluntarily.
</p>

<h3>Why I Started Reading</h3>

<p>
Reading slowed me down in the best way. It gave me space to think. Unlike videos or articles, a book doesn’t rush you. You move at your own pace. And in that space, I found clarity. It also helped me focus longer, reflect deeper, and stay offline more often.
</p>

<p>
I also realized that good books are like long conversations with smart people. You’re not just entertained—you’re learning how someone else thinks, sees, lives. That became addictive in a way scrolling never was.
</p>

<h3>My Favorite Books (So Far)</h3>

<p>Here are some of the books that hit hardest or stayed with me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_War_of_Art" target="_blank">The War of Art – Steven Pressfield</a><br>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/548604.Steal_Like_an_Artist" target="_blank">Steal Like an Artist – Austin Kleon</a><br>

  Gentle and simple. A Japanese concept of purpose, health, and living with intention.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>
Reading gave me something I didn’t even realize I was missing: mental stillness. The kind of focus you don’t get from your phone or your laptop. Just one sentence at a time, pulling you in. And slowly, you feel yourself returning to the world with more clarity.
</p>

<p>
I still don’t read every day. But when I do, it feels like time well spent. And in a busy, noisy life—that’s rare.
