            <h2>Room Clock on a Breadboard</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Update – 2025:</strong> A small room clock built with a Raspberry Pi Pico,
                an RTC module, and a display — all wired up on a breadboard.<br>
                <span style="color:#888;">
                    Simple hardware, simple code, but surprisingly useful.
                </span>
            </p>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                I wanted a small device that shows the current date, time,
                and room temperature at a glance.
                No Wi-Fi, no apps, no syncing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just something that sits on my desk, always on,
                and quietly does its job.
            </p>

            <h3>Why the Raspberry Pi Pico?</h3>
            <p>
                The Raspberry Pi Pico is perfect for this kind of project.
                It boots instantly, uses very little power,
                and works great for simple hardware-focused builds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Everything is connected on a breadboard,
                which makes it easy to tweak, modify, or expand later.
            </p>

            <h3>The RTC (Real-Time Clock)</h3>
            <p>
                The clock uses an RTC module with a coin cell battery.
                This means it keeps track of the time even if the power is unplugged.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the power goes out, the Pico forgets nothing.
                When power comes back, the correct time is still there.
            </p>

            <h3>What It Displays</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Current date</li>
                <li>Current time</li>
                <li>Current room temperature</li>
                <li>Minimum temperature ever measured</li>
                <li>Maximum temperature ever measured</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The minimum and maximum temperatures are stored
                and only update when a new record is reached.
            </p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Raspberry Pi Pico</li>
                <li>RTC module with coin cell battery</li>
                <li>Temperature sensor (via RTC or separate sensor)</li>
                <li>Small display</li>
                <li>Breadboard wiring</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The Pico continuously reads the time from the RTC
                and the temperature from the sensor.
            </p>

            <p>
                The lowest and highest temperatures ever measured
                are stored so they don’t reset when the device restarts.
            </p>

            <h3>Why I Like This Project</h3>
            <p>
                It’s not a smart device.
                It doesn’t connect to anything.
            </p>

            <p>
                It just works.
            </p>

            <p>
                There’s something really nice about building
                a small standalone device that does exactly one thing
                and does it well.
            </p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                This project lives permanently on my desk now.
                It’s simple, reliable, and completely mine.
            </p>

            <p>
                And knowing that it keeps time even during a power cut
                thanks to that tiny coin cell battery
                makes it feel oddly satisfying.
            </p>
