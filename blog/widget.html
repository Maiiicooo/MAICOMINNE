<h2>Why did i made a habit widget?</h2>

<p><strong>Update – 10/04/2025:</strong> A small personal widget I made to track my Habits throughout the year.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>
    I didn’t want to pay for another monthly subscription just to track a simple habit. All I needed was a way to keep
    myself accountable—nothing fancy. Just something quiet and visual that stays on my homescreen and reminds me to
    keep going.
</p>

<p>
    I ended up using Scriptable, a lightweight iOS app that lets you make your own widgets with a bit of JavaScript.
    I’m not a daily coder or anything, but this was a fun little side project that turned out better than expected.
</p>

<h3>What It Shows</h3>

<p>
    The widget displays every day of the year as a small dot. It’s color-coded:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Green for days I worked out</li>
    <li>Red for days I didn’t</li>
    <li>Gray for anything before I started or that’s still ahead</li>
</ul>

<p>
    At the bottom, it also shows your current streak. If you’ve worked out 7 days in a row, it simply says: “7 day streak”.
</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>
    It’s super basic. I set a start date (April 2nd for me), and whenever I skip a day, I add the number of that day to
    a small list inside the code. No logging, no forms, no syncing. Just open the file and update it every once in a while.
</p>

<h3>Set Up</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/scriptable/id1405459188" target="_blank">Scriptable</a> from the App Store</li>
    <li>Create a new script and paste the code</li>
    <li>Edit the name of your habit, your start date, and the days you missed</li>
    <li>Run the script and add it as a medium widget on your homescreen</li>
</ol>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>
    You can <a href="blog/files/habit-tracker-scriptable.txt" download>download the full script here</a>.  
    It’s just a text file you open in Scriptable. Nothing more.
</p>

<h3>Final Notes</h3>

<p>
    The only part you’ll ever need to change is right at the top. That’s where you set your habit name, start date,
    and the list of missed days. Everything else takes care of itself—how it looks, how it works.
</p>

<p>
    It won’t log anything for you. It won’t sync with any app. But it’s quiet, simple, and does exactly what I need.
</p>

<p>
    And best of all: it’s free :)
