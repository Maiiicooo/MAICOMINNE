<p><strong>Update – 08/04/2025:</strong> Part 1 of my marathon journey. Weekly updates until Bruges on August 31.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>
    I used to smoke a lot(sometime's i still), barely moved, and the idea of running a marathon sounded
    insane. But somewhere deep down, I knew I needed a change. Something that required discipline. Something that would
    hurt. Something you couldn’t skip, scroll past, or fake.
</p>

<p>
    So I started running. On a random Wednesday. No special reason. No big moment. Just the feeling that if I didn’t
    move now, I might never start at all.
</p>

<h3>Week 1 — The Switch</h3>

<p>
    It started on a rainy Wednesday. Work had drained me. Everything felt dull. Instead of sinking into the couch, I put
    on my old sneakers and ran out the door.
</p>

<p>
    Thirteen minutes. That’s all I managed. I thought I was dying. But I felt alive. That contrast was enough to make me
    want more.
</p>

<h3>Week 2 — Structure & Struggle</h3>

<p>
    I committed to a training plan, slowly building toward the half marathon in Torhout on June 21. No ego runs. No
    heroic distances. Just consistency: three runs per week, slow progress. The hardest part was mental—learning to stop
    overthinking and start moving.
</p>

<p>
    On day four, I experienced my first runner’s high. It was short but intense. Suddenly, I understood why people do
    this for fun.
</p>

<h3>Week 3 — TBA</h3>

<p>
    Coming soon.
</p>

<h3>Week 4 — TBA</h3>

<p>
    Coming soon.
</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>
    Why am I doing this? Not for medals. Not for clout. But to prove to myself that I can commit to something fully. No
    shortcuts. No excuses. Just shoes on, head up, and forward. Every week, a little better.
</p>

<p>
    I believe there’s strength in slowness. The world moves fast, but character takes time to build.
</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
    Every kilometer teaches me something. About discipline, patience, self-respect, and listening to my body. But it
    also teaches me to take myself more seriously. If you have the guts to start, you deserve the space to grow.
</p>

<p>
    The best part? You see progress, physically and mentally. No algorithm needed. No external validation. Your body
    doesn’t lie.
</p>

<h3>The Road to Bruges</h3>

<p>
    This is just the beginning. On June 21, I’ll run my first half marathon in Torhout. That’ll be my first real test.
    After that, I’ll keep building toward the full marathon in Bruges on August 31. I’ll update this blog weekly—raw,
    honest, and unfiltered.
</p>

<p>
    The finish line is far. But the value lies in the road itself.
