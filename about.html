  <p>
    Maico Minne is a passionate self-taught software enthusiast who studied Software Engineering at Howest University of
    Applied Sciences in Bruges. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, he chose not to complete his final year. With a
    long-standing interest in electricity and hands-on work, Maico transitioned into the solar energy and HVAC industries.
    He steadily advanced through the ranks, working as a site supervisor for two years and eventually growing into his
    current role as a Service Coordinator and Planner in the HVAC sector. Outside of his professional
    career, Maico remains actively engaged in software development through personal projects. He is also pursuing his
    entrepreneurial goals as an independent sandblasting specialist.
